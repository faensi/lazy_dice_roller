    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: 02.01.2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      Thank you for using <em>Lazy Dice Roller</em> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how 
      I, <strong>Hubertus Knobling</strong> (“I,” “me,” or “my”), handle any information related 
      to your use of the App. The App is available on the Google Play Store.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected</h2>
    <p>
      I do not collect, store, or process any personal information within the App. The App 
      functions locally on your device and does not require or request your name, email address, 
      location, or any other personal details.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Google Play:</strong> The App is distributed via the Google Play Store. 
      Google may collect certain non-personally identifiable information 
      (e.g., download statistics, crash reports, or device information) as part of its 
      normal operation. This data is governed by 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>In-App Data:</strong> The App itself does not integrate any third-party 
      analytics, ads, or tracking mechanisms. Therefore, I do not have access to data 
      that could identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      I do not integrate or embed any third-party services (advertising networks, analytics 
      providers, etc.) that would track or share user data. If, in the future, I add such 
      services, I will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Since the App does not collect any personal information, it is neither directed to nor 
      restricted from children. I do not knowingly collect personal data from children. 
      If you believe a child has provided personal information via any other channel 
      (e.g., email support), please contact me so I can remove it.
    </p>

    <h2>5. GDPR and CCPA Notice</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong>  
      Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) should note that I do not collect or 
      process personal data within the App. If you voluntarily provide information by 
      contacting me (e.g., via email), I will only use that data to respond to your 
      inquiry and will not retain it longer than necessary. If you have any questions 
      about your data rights (access, correction, erasure, restriction), please 
      contact me using the information below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong>  
      I do not sell or share personal information. Since I do not collect data, 
      there is no personal information to disclose or delete. However, if you are a 
      California resident and believe you have somehow provided personal information 
      (for example, via email), please contact me to request disclosure or deletion. 
      I do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my 
      practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates 
      will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Me</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App, 
      please contact me at: <strong>knobling.hubertus@gmail.com</strong>
